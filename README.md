**4RN3-chain-ts** is a modular, AI-powered full-stack development stack built on TypeScript. It leverages multiple state-of-the-art AI models, a flexible architecture, and lightweight developer ergonomics to provide a smart, OOP-friendly foundation for modern application and library development.

This repo defines the **stack itself** — including conventions, model roles, and technology pairings — not any specific app or plugin built on top of it.

## 🧠 Overview

**4RN3-chain-ts** combines the strengths of different AI models and modern dev tools to form a reasoning-first, shell-friendly TypeScript ecosystem:

| Purpose               | Tooling |
|-----------------------|---------|
| Codegen (OOP/TS)      | Claude |
| Fast boilerplate      | GPT-4o |
| Reasoning/docs/plans  | o3 or o4 |
| UI (if applicable)    | Nuxt 3, Tauri (desktop) |
| DB (if applicable)    | Postgres |
| Runtime               | TypeScript (pref. [Bun](https://bun.sh)) |

Each model in the stack is chosen for a specific role. This lets you build fast, well-structured applications using task decomposition, automated bugfixing, and domain-specific reasoning — all with minimal overhead.

## ✨ Features

- 🧩 **AI-driven modular architecture** with model-task mapping
- 🧠 **Model-specialized logic**: use the right AI for the right job (reasoning, codegen, boilerplate, etc.)
- ⚙️ **Shell-capable agent layer** for testing, bugfixing, and orchestration
- 💻 **Optional UI layer** with [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/)
- 🖥️ **Optional Desktop UI support** with [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app/)
- 🗃️ **Optional database support** with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- 🔋 **TypeScript-native** with focus on OOP and modularity
- 🪶 **Lightweight by default**, expandable via plugins, services, and tools

---

## 🛠️ Installation

To use or extend the stack, you’ll need:

- **Bun** (preferred): [https://bun.sh](https://bun.sh)
- Or Node.js + your TS toolchain of choice
- No memory or persistence layer required — everything is prompt-injected
- **Note:** this is the recommended stack — anything above can be replaced with your own use

---

## 🧪 Usage

This repo doesn’t define a single CLI or binary — instead, it outlines how to structure your stack or toolchain using:

- Claude for structured OOP code
- GPT-4o for fast generation (e.g., LICENSE, README, boilerplate)
- o3/o4 for deeper reasoning (e.g., planning, design docs, complex logic)

How you use the stack is up to you: it could power a CLI, be integrated into dev tools, run as a service, or support a full-stack app.

---

## 🧱 Philosophy
- Don’t generalize everything. Use models for what they’re best at.
- Stateless by default. You don’t need memory if you can prompt smartly.
- Modularity over framework. Compose small model tasks instead of monoliths.

## 🚧 Status

Actively in development. This is the stack definition repo — actual plugins, apps, and helpers may live in separate repositories under the same namespace.
